# Server_-monitoring_dashboard

To see the monitor:
- pip3 install -r requirements.txt (to install the required modules)
- python3 server_monitor.py (to run the script)

Here is a step-by-step guide to help you build a server monitoring dashboard using Python:
Step 1: Install the required packages
- Begin by installing the necessary Python packages. You will need packages such as psutil, matplotlib, and Flask.
- Use pip to install the packages by running the following commands:

  pip3 install psutil
  pip3 install matplotlib
  pip3 install Flask

Step 2: Retrieve server performance data
- Import the required modules, including psutil, to access system information.
import psutil
import matplotlib
import flask

- Use the psutil package to retrieve real-time information about CPU usage, memory utilization, disk space, and network statistics. You can explore the psutil documentation for more information on available functions and methods.

Step 2.2: Retrieve CPU usage information
cpu_usage = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=None)  # Set interval to None for current usage
print("CPU Usage: {}%".format(cpu_usage))

Step 2.3: Retrieve memory utilization information
memory = psutil.virtual_memory()
total_memory = memory.total
available_memory = memory.available
memory_usage = memory.percent
print("Total Memory: {} bytes".format(total_memory))
print("Available Memory: {} bytes".format(available_memory))
print("Memory Usage: {}%".format(memory_usage))

Step 2.4: Retrieve disk space information
disk_usage = psutil.disk_usage('/')
total_disk_space = disk_usage.total
used_disk_space = disk_usage.used
free_disk_space = disk_usage.free
disk_space_usage = disk_usage.percent
print("Total Disk Space: {} bytes".format(total_disk_space))
print("Used Disk Space: {} bytes".format(used_disk_space))
print("Free Disk Space: {} bytes".format(free_disk_space))
print("Disk Space Usage: {}%".format(disk_space_usage))

Step 2.5: Retrieve network statistics
network_stats = psutil.net_io_counters()
bytes_sent = network_stats.bytes_sent
bytes_received = network_stats.bytes_recv
packets_sent = network_stats.packets_sent
packets_received = network_stats.packets_recv
print("Bytes Sent: {}".format(bytes_sent))
print("Bytes Received: {}".format(bytes_received))
print("Packets Sent: {}".format(packets_sent))
print("Packets Received: {}".format(packets_received))

2.2-2.5 These steps will allow you to retrieve real-time information about CPU usage, memory utilization, disk space, and network statistics using the `psutil` package in Python. You can then further process or display this information as needed in your server monitoring dashboard.

Step 3: Create the dashboard interface
- Use a suitable GUI framework for creating the dashboard. One popular choice is Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python.
- Create a Flask application and define the necessary routes.
- Create HTML templates using suitable styling frameworks like Bootstrap or CSS.

Step 4: Display the server performance data
- In the Flask routes, retrieve the server performance data using the psutil package.
- Pass this data to the HTML templates for display within the dashboard.
- Use appropriate data visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Chart.js to present the information in graphs or charts.

Step 5: Add dynamic updates
- Implement periodic updates to fetch real-time data from the server at regular intervals.
- You can achieve this by using JavaScript or AJAX to make asynchronous requests to the server and update the dashboard without refreshing the entire page.

Step 6: Run the server monitoring dashboard
- Start the Flask application to run the server monitoring dashboard.
- Open a web browser and access the specified URL to view and interact with the dashboard.
Remember to always test and debug your code along the way to ensure smooth functionality. Also, refer to the documentation for the packages you are using for more detailed instructions and examples.
Good luck with building your server monitoring dashboard!
